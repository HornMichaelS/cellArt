# CellArt

CellArt is an experiment in creating art through cellular automata, such as Conway's Game of Life. 

Systems such as Conway's 'Life', which display unpredictable and emergent properties based on simple rules, have always held a certain fascination with me, and I wanted to see what would happen if those rules were tweaked. Or what might happen if the rules changed mid-simulation. Or if cells were colored randomly, or differently depending on their state. These and other questions led me to start this project. I've been interested in web development for some time now as well, and what better way than to implement my idea as a web application. As such, this project is also an exercise in javascript programming, the React framework, HTML5 + CSS, and 2D graphics rendering.

If you feel like contributing your own ideas, or simply critiquing my design/implementation, please feel free to fork the project or send me a message.
